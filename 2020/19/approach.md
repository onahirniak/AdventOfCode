### Thoughts:

Seems like the problem can be solved by DFS. Basically, I have a DAG here and need to traverse it.
Also, the question: how can I check quickly if we still match to possible answer or not.
Probably we can try to use Trie for it and traverse the Trie using our rules. 

Need to check the idea...
